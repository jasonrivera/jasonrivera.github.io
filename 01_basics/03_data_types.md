# Concept: Data Types

# What is it?
# Python has different data types like numbers, text, and booleans.

# What are the most important things to know?
# Common types: int, float, str, bool. You can check a type with type().

# Syntax & Example:
# type(42)  # int
type('Hi')  # str

# Real-world analogy:
# Think of data types like the type of item in a box: number, word, true/false flag, etc.
