# Concept: Type Conversion

# What is it?
# You can convert one type to another using functions like int(), str(), float().

# What are the most important things to know?
# Only convert when it makes sense (e.g. '5' -> 5).

# Syntax & Example:
# age = int('30')
name = str(123)

# Real-world analogy:
# Itâ€™s like turning a string of numbers into an actual calculator number.
