# Concept: Comments

# What is it?
# Comments help you explain your code. Python ignores them.

# What are the most important things to know?
# Use # for single-line comments, ''' or """ for multiline.

# Syntax & Example:
# # This is a comment

# Real-world analogy:
# Comments are like sticky notes in your code for humans, not computers.
