# Concept: String Operations

# What is it?
# You can work with strings using methods like .upper(), .lower(), .replace().

# What are the most important things to know?
# Strings are objects, so you can call methods on them.

# Syntax & Example:
# 'hello'.upper()  # 'HELLO'

# Real-world analogy:
# Itâ€™s like using tools to cut, copy, or clean up words.
