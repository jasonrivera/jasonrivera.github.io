# ðŸ”€ Conditionals

This folder contains drills and challenges for learning how to make decisions in Python using:

- `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements
- Comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, etc.)
- Logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)
- Nested conditionals

Conditionals let you control the flow of your program based on logic, user input, or other values. Practice here focuses on building that decision-making skill.
