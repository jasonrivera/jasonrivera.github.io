# Concept: If/Else Statements

# What is it?
# If/else lets your program make decisions and run different code depending on conditions.

# What are the most important things to know?
# Use if to test a condition, elif for another, else as a fallback.

# Syntax & Example:
# age = 18
if age >= 18:
    print('Adult')
else:
    print('Minor')

# Real-world analogy:
# It’s like choosing what to wear based on the weather—raincoat if it’s raining, t-shirt if it’s sunny.
