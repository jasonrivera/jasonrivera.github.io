# Concept: Logical Operators

# What is it?
# Logical operators combine conditions: and, or, not.

# What are the most important things to know?
# and = both must be True; or = at least one True; not = flips True/False.

# Syntax & Example:
# True and False  # False
not True  # False

# Real-world analogy:
# Itâ€™s like checking: Is the door locked **and** alarm on?
