# Concept: Truthy and Falsy

# What is it?
# Some values are treated like True or False in conditions.

# What are the most important things to know?
# 0, '', [], None = Falsy. Anything else = Truthy.

# Syntax & Example:
# if []:
    print('This won’t run')

# Real-world analogy:
# It’s like saying an empty glass = False, a full one = True.
