# Concept: For Loops

# What is it?
# For loops let you repeat code over a sequence like a list or range.

# What are the most important things to know?
# Use range() for numbers, or loop directly over lists.

# Syntax & Example:
# for i in range(3):
    print(i)

# Real-world analogy:
# Itâ€™s like going through each item on a checklist.
