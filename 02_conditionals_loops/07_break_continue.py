# Concept: Break & Continue

# What is it?
# break stops a loop early; continue skips to the next loop iteration.

# What are the most important things to know?
# Useful for controlling loop behavior.

# Syntax & Example:
# for i in range(5):
    if i == 3: break

# Real-world analogy:
# break = slamming on the brakes; continue = skipping a song on a playlist.
