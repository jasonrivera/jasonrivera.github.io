# Concept: Functions Intro

# What is it?
# Functions let you group code into reusable blocks.

# What are the most important things to know?
# Define with def, call by name. Helps organize and reuse code.

# Syntax & Example:
# def greet():
    print('Hello')
greet()

# Real-world analogy:
# Itâ€™s like writing a recipe you can reuse anytime you want to cook that dish.
