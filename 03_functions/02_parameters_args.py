# Concept: Parameters and Arguments

# What is it?
# Parameters are placeholders in a function; arguments are actual values you pass in.

# What are the most important things to know?
# Let you customize function behavior with inputs.

# Syntax & Example:
# def greet(name):
    print(f'Hi {name}')
greet('Jason')

# Real-world analogy:
# Think of parameters like blank lines on a form and arguments as what you fill in.
