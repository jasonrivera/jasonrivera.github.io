# Concept: Return Values

# What is it?
# Functions can return results using the return keyword.

# What are the most important things to know?
# You can store the result in a variable or use it directly.

# Syntax & Example:
# def add(a, b):
    return a + b
result = add(2, 3)

# Real-world analogy:
# Itâ€™s like a vending machine giving you the snack you selected.
