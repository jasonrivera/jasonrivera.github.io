# Concept: Scope

# What is it?
# Scope controls where a variable can be accessed (inside or outside a function).

# What are the most important things to know?
# Variables inside functions are local; outside are global.

# Syntax & Example:
# def func():
    x = 5  # local to func

# Real-world analogy:
# Itâ€™s like a walkie-talkie that only works in a certain room.
