# Concept: Lambda Functions

# What is it?
# Lambda functions are small, anonymous functions for quick tasks.

# What are the most important things to know?
# Use when you need a function once, especially inside other functions.

# Syntax & Example:
# square = lambda x: x * x

# Real-world analogy:
# Think of it like a one-line shortcut or sticky note function.
