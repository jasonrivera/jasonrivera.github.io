# Concept: Docstrings

# What is it?
# Docstrings are special comments inside functions that describe what they do.

# What are the most important things to know?
# Use triple quotes right after the function definition.

# Syntax & Example:
# def greet():
    """Prints a greeting."""
    print('Hello')

# Real-world analogy:
# Itâ€™s like the instructions manual inside a product box.
