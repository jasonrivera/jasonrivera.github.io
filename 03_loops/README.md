# 🔁 Loops

This folder is all about writing code that repeats. I’ll practice with:

- `for` loops
- `while` loops
- `break` and `continue` statements
- Looping over strings, lists, and ranges
- Nested loops

Loops are how you make Python do the boring stuff for you. I’ll use them constantly, so these reps are key.
