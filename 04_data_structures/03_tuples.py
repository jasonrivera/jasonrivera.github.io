# Concept: Tuples

# What is it?
# Tuples are like lists but can’t be changed (immutable).

# What are the most important things to know?
# Use () to define. Great for fixed collections.

# Syntax & Example:
# coords = (4, 5)

# Real-world analogy:
# Think of it like a locked list—you can look, but not edit.
