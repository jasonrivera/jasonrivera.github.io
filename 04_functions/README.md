# ðŸ§© Functions

This folder covers how to organize code into reusable blocks. Iâ€™ll practice:

- Writing basic functions with `def`
- Passing arguments and returning values
- Default parameters
- Scope (local vs global variables)
- Chaining multiple functions together

Functions are the foundation of clean, reusable, and readable codeâ€”so this is a big one.
