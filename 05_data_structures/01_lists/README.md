# ðŸ“‹ Lists

Lists are ordered, changeable collections. Iâ€™ll use them *a lot*.

In this folder, Iâ€™ll practice:
- Creating lists
- Accessing items with indexes
- Adding, removing, and updating values
- Looping through lists
- Common list methods like `.append()`, `.pop()`, `.sort()`, etc.

Lists are great for storing sequences of related data like tasks, names, or scores.
