# ðŸ—‚ Dictionaries

Dictionaries store data as key-value pairs, which makes them super useful for fast lookups.

Iâ€™ll cover:
- Creating and updating dictionaries
- Accessing values by key
- Looping through dictionaries
- Useful methods like `.get()`, `.items()`, and `.keys()`

Think of dictionaries like mini databases inside your code.
