# ğŸ”’ Tuples

Tuples are like lists, but **immutable** (they canâ€™t be changed after creation).

In this folder, Iâ€™ll learn:
- When to use a tuple instead of a list
- Tuple packing and unpacking
- Indexing and looping
- Why immutability matters

Tuples are perfect when you want to group data that shouldnâ€™t change.
