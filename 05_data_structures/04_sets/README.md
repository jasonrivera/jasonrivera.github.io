# ðŸ§® Sets

Sets are unordered collections of unique itemsâ€”great for filtering out duplicates or comparing data.

Practice includes:
- Creating sets
- Adding and removing elements
- Set operations like union, intersection, and difference
- Checking membership

Sets are a bit more advanced, but super powerful once you get the hang of them.
