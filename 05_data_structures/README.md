# ðŸ§± Data Structures

This folder introduces the core data structures in Python.

Each subfolder focuses on a specific structureâ€”what it is, how it works, and when to use it. These are the building blocks for handling and organizing data in real programs.

Covered in this section:
- Lists
- Dictionaries
- Tuples
- Sets

Iâ€™ll practice creating, modifying, and using each one through drills and mini-challenges.
