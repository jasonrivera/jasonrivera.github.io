# Concept: Creating Modules

# What is it?
# You can split your code into multiple files (modules) for better organization.

# What are the most important things to know?
# A module is just a .py file you can import.

# Syntax & Example:
# # In helper.py: def greet(): print('Hi')
# In main.py: import helper

# Real-world analogy:
# Itâ€™s like writing your own toolbox you can use in different projects.
