# Concept: File Reading

# What is it?
# Python can read text files using the open() function.

# What are the most important things to know?
# Use read(), readline(), or readlines() to get content.

# Syntax & Example:
# with open('file.txt') as f:
    content = f.read()

# Real-world analogy:
# Like opening a book and reading it cover to cover or line by line.
