# Concept: Working with Paths

# What is it?
# Paths help you find files and folders in your computerâ€™s file system.

# What are the most important things to know?
# Use the pathlib module for clean and cross-platform path handling.

# Syntax & Example:
# from pathlib import Path
path = Path('data/file.txt')

# Real-world analogy:
# Like using a map to find where a file lives on your computer.
