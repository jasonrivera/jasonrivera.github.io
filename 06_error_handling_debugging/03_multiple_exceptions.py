# Concept: Multiple Exceptions

# What is it?
# You can catch different error types using multiple except blocks.

# What are the most important things to know?
# Order matters—most specific errors should come first.

# Syntax & Example:
# try:
    ...
except ValueError:
    ...
except Exception:

# Real-world analogy:
# It’s like having different fire drills for different emergencies.
