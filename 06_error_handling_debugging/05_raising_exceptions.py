# Concept: Raising Exceptions

# What is it?
# You can raise your own errors using raise.

# What are the most important things to know?
# Useful to stop the program when something goes wrong intentionally.

# Syntax & Example:
# if age < 0:
    raise ValueError('Age cannot be negative')

# Real-world analogy:
# Like pulling the emergency brake when somethingâ€™s wrong.
