# 🐍 Python Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal Python learning repository! This is where I’m building up my skills by studying one concept at a time and practicing regularly with structured exercises and hands-on projects.

---

## 📚 Structure

The project is organized by concept area, and each one contains:
- Core learning files (`01_variables.md`, `02_strings.md`, etc.)
- An `exercises/` folder with practice sessions broken down by topic

Example:
01_basics/ ├── 01_variables.md ├── ... └── exercises/ ├── 01_variables_exercise_1.py


---

## 🔁 Workflow

Each time I practice:
- I create a new Python file in the matching `exercises/` folder
- I commit and push the session to GitHub
- I log the session in `SESSION_LOG.md`

---

## ✅ Topics Covered

- Python Basics (variables, strings, math, input/output)
- Conditionals & Loops
- Functions
- Data Structures (lists, dicts, sets, tuples)
- Modules, File I/O
- Error Handling & Debugging
- Practice Projects

---

## 🛠 Projects (Planned So Far)

- Number Guessing Game
- Simple Calculator
- To-Do List App
- Rock, Paper, Scissors
- Mad Libs Generator
- Basic Quiz App

More coming soon...

## 📈 Goal

Practice Python consistently, document my growth, and become confident in core programming concepts — one green GitHub square at a time. 💪
