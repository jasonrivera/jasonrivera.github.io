# 🐍 Python Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal Python learning repo! This is where I’m practicing one concept at a time—doing quick drills, small challenges, and building full projects as I go.

---

## 📚 Structure

The repo is organized by concept. Each concept folder contains:
- A `drills/` folder with short, focused exercises to lock in the basics  
- A `challenges/` folder with small projects that apply the concept in real-world-ish ways  
- A running log of bigger, multi-concept **recap projects** is stored in the `recap_projects/` folder  

Example:

```
python_learning/
├── 01_variables/
│   ├── 1_drills/
│   │   └── variable_drill_1.py
│   ├── 2_challenges/
│   │   └── character_sheet_generator.py
│
├── recap_projects/
│   └── week_1_project.py
```

All core concept notes are now stored in Notion.

## 🔁 Workflow

Each time I learn something new:
- I review the Notion concept guide for that topic  
- I practice by completing 2–3 drills in the appropriate folder  
- I tackle at least one challenge to apply what I’ve learned  
- I push everything to GitHub and log my progress
