# 🔁 Recap Projects

This folder is for mini-projects that recap everything I’ve learned after every few concepts. These aren’t full applications, but focused exercises that combine multiple skills I’ve practiced so far.

The goal of recap projects is to:
- Apply several recent concepts at once
- Reinforce what I’ve learned in a creative way
- Track my progress over time

Example ideas:
- A calculator using variables, math, and input
- A basic form validator using strings and conditionals
- A number guessing game using loops and user input

Each recap project reflects a milestone in my learning journey.
